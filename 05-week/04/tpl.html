    <h1 style="font-family: 'Modak', cursive; font-size: 3rem;">Nothing more than strangers
        Passing by out on the street
        Memories are fading though
        It's only been a week
        All the little things are gone
        The things we used to be
        Nobody could take us down
        There was only you and me
    </h1>

    <h2>And without you I can't be
        You're the universe to me
        You're the air in my lungs
        You're the fields where I run
        You're the sky where I'm floating
    </h2>

    <h3>It's you, you, you
        It's you, woah
    </h3>

    <p>And without you I can't be
        You're the universe to me
        You're the air in my lungs
        You're the fields where I run
        You're the sky where I'm floating
    </p>

    <h1>It's you, you, you
        It's you, woah
    </h1>

    <h5>Don't want to be a stranger
        Want to be the one you need
        I can be your world, your life
        Your lover, all for free
        All the little things come back
        The things we used to be
        Nobody can take us down there
        It's only you and me
    </h5>

    <h6>And without you I can't be
        You're the universe to me
        You're the air in my lungs
        You're the fields where I run
        You're the sky where I'm floating
